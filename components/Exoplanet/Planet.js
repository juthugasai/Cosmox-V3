    description: '51 Pegasi b, officially named Dimidium /dɪˈmɪdiəm/, and also known as Bellerophon /bɛˈlɛrəfɒn/, is an extrasolar planet approximately 50 light-years (15 parsecs) away in the constellation of Pegasus. It was the first exoplanet to be discovered orbiting a main-sequence star,[1] the Sun-like 51 Pegasi, and marked a breakthrough in astronomical research. It is the prototype for a class of planets called hot Jupiters.[2]In 2017, traces of water were discovered in the planets atmosphere.[3] In 2019, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in part for the discovery of 51 Pegasi b.51 Pegasi is the Flamsteed designation of the host star. The planet was originally designated 51 Pegasi b by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, who discovered the planet in December 1995. The following year it was unofficially dubbed "Bellerophon" by astronomer Geoffrey Marcy, who followed the convention of naming planets after Greek and Roman mythological figures (Bellerophon is a figure from Greek mythology who rode the winged horse Pegasus).In July 2014, the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.[6] The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.[7] In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name for this planet was Dimidium.[8] The name was submitted by the Astronomische Gesellschaft Luzern (German for Astronomical Society of Lucerne), Switzerland. Dimidium is Latin for half, referring to the planets mass of approximately half the mass of Jupiter.',

    description:'Kepler-452b (sometimes quoted to be an Earth 2.0 or Earths Cousin[3][4] based on its characteristics; also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-7016.01) is a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the inner edge of the habitable zone of the sun-like star Kepler-452 and is the only planet in the system discovered by Kepler. It is located about 1,800 light-years (550 pc)[5] from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.Kepler-452b orbits its star at a distance of 1.04 AU (156 million km; 97 million mi) from its host star (nearly the same distance as Earth from the Sun), with an orbital period of roughly 384 days, has a mass at least five times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.5 times that of Earth. It is the first potentially rocky super-Earth[5] planet discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of a very sunlike star.[6] However, it is unknown if it is entirely habitable, as it is receiving slightly more energy than Earth and could be subjected to a runaway greenhouse effect.The Kepler space telescope identified the exoplanet, and its discovery was announced by NASA on 23 July 2015.[7] The planet is about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) away from the Solar System. At the speed of the New Horizons spacecraft, at about 59,000 km/h (16,000 m/s; 37,000 mph), it would take approximately 30 million years to get there.',

    description:'Kepler-186f (also known by its Kepler object of interest designation KOI-571.05) is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Kepler-186,[4][5][6] about 580 light-years (180 parsecs) from Earth.[7]It was the first planet with a radius similar to Earths to be discovered in the habitable zone of another star. NASAs Kepler space telescope detected it using the transit method, along with four additional planets orbiting much closer to the star (all modestly larger than Earth).[5]Analysis of three years of data was required to find its signal.[8] The results were presented initially at a conference on 19 March 2014[9] and some details were reported in the media at the time.[10] The public announcement was on 17 April 2014,[2] followed by publication in Science.The only physical property directly derivable from the observations (besides orbit) is the size of the planet relative to the central star, which follows from the amount of occultation of stellar light during a transit. This ratio was measured to be 0.021,[1] giving a planetary radius of 1.11±0.14 times that of Earth.[2][5] The planet is about 11% larger in radius than Earth (between 4.5% smaller and 26.5% larger), giving a volume about 1.37 times that of Earth (between 0.87 and 2.03 times as large).A very wide range of possible masses can be calculated by combining the radius with densities derived from the possible types of matter from which planets can be made. For example, it could be a rocky terrestrial planet or a lower density ocean planet with a thick atmosphere. A massive hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere is thought to be unlikely in a planet with a radius below 1.5 REarth. Planets with a radius of more than 1.5 times that of Earth tend to accumulate the thick atmospheres which make them less likely to be habitable.[11] Red dwarfs emit a much stronger extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux when young than later in life. The planets primordial atmosphere would have been subjected to elevated photoevaporation during that period, which would probably have largely removed any H/He-rich envelope through hydrodynamic mass loss.Mass estimates range from 0.32 MEarth for a pure water/ice composition to 3.77 MEarth if made up entirely of iron (both implausible extremes). For a body with radius 1.11 REarth, a composition similar to that of Earth (i.e., 1/3 iron, 2/3 silicate rock) yields a mass of 1.44 MEarth,[1] taking into account the higher density due to the higher average pressure compared to Earth.[citation needed] That would make the force of gravity on the surface 17% higher than on Earth.The estimated equilibrium temperature for Kepler-186f, which is the surface temperature without an atmosphere, is said to be around 188 K (−85 °C; −121 °F), somewhat colder than the equilibrium temperature of Mars.',

    description:'Gliese 876 d is an exoplanet approximately 15 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876. It was the lowest-mass extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12 at the time of its discovery. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial velocity has one problem, it is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° with respect to the plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.[1]The low mass of the planet has led to suggestions that it may be a terrestrial planet. This type of massive terrestrial planet could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the inward migration of the gas giants.Alternatively the planet could have formed further from Gliese 876, as a gas giant, and migrated inwards with the other gas giants. This would result in a composition richer in volatile substances, such as water. As it arrived in range, the star would have blown off the planets hydrogen layer via coronal mass ejection.[3] In this model, the planet would have a pressurised ocean of water (in the form of a supercritical fluid) separated from the silicate core by a layer of ice kept frozen by the high pressures in the planetary interior. Such a planet would have an atmosphere containing water vapor and free oxygen produced by the breakdown of water by ultraviolet radiation.Distinguishing between these two models would require more information about the planets radius or composition. The planet does not transit its star,[5] which makes obtaining this information impossible with current observational capabilities.Based on models, the radius of the exoplanet, based on the mass, can probably be estimated around 1.65 REarth.[citation needed]The equilibrium temperature of Gliese 876 d, is estimated to be around 614 K (341 °C; 646 °F).',

    description:'Gliese 436 b /ˈɡliːzə/ (sometimes called GJ 436 b,[7] formally named Awohali[2]) is a Neptune-sized exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 436.[1] It was the first hot Neptune discovered with certainty (in 2007) and was among the smallest-known transiting planets in mass and radius, until the much smaller Kepler exoplanet discoveries began circa 2010.In December 2013, NASA reported that clouds may have been detected in the atmosphere of GJ 436 b.Gliese 436 b was discovered in August 2004 by R. Paul Butler and Geoffrey Marcy of the Carnegie Institute of Washington and University of California, Berkeley, respectively, using the radial velocity method. Together with 55 Cancri e, it was the first of a new class of planets with a minimum mass (M sini) similar to Neptune.The planet was recorded to transit its star by an automatic process at NMSU on January 11, 2005, but this event went unheeded at the time.[13] In 2007, Michael Gillon from Geneva University in Switzerland led a team that observed the transit, grazing the stellar disc relative to Earth. Transit observations led to the determination of its exact mass and radius, both of which are very similar to that of Neptune, making Gliese 436 b at that time the smallest known transiting extrasolar planet. The planet is about four thousand kilometers larger in diameter than Uranus and five thousand kilometers larger than Neptune and slightly more massive. Gliese 436b orbits at a distance of four million kilometers or one-fifteenth the average distance of Mercury from the Sun.',

    description:'Kepler-62f[1][2][4] (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-701.04) is a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the star Kepler-62, the outermost of five such planets discovered around the star by NASAs Kepler spacecraft. It is located about 980 light-years (300 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Lyra.[5]Kepler-62f orbits its star at a distance of 0.718 AU (107,400,000 km; 66,700,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 267.3 days, and has a radius of around 1.41 times that of Earth. It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is a relatively quiet star, and has less mass than the Sun – thus it can live up to a span of about 30 billion years or so.[6] Based on its size, Kepler-62f is likely a terrestrial or ocean-covered planet. However, key components of the exoplanet still need to be assessed to determine habitability; such as its atmosphere if one exists, since it lies within the outer part of its host stars habitable zone.[1][7]The discovery of the exoplanet (along with Kepler-62e) was announced in April 2013 by NASA as part of the Kepler spacecraft data release.[1] The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. According to scientists, it is a potential candidate to search for extraterrestrial life, and was chosen as one of the targets to study by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program.',

    description:
    "Barnard's Star b (also designated GJ 699 b) was a proposed super-Earth-mass exoplanet orbiting Barnard's Star in the constellation of Ophiuchus, six light-years away from Earth. The exoplanet's discovery by an international team of astronomers – including the European Southern Observatory and Carnegie Institution for Science – was officially announced on 14 November 2018.[2][3] More recent studies, in 2021 and 2022, have concluded that the radial velocity signal corresponding to Barnard's Star b is most likely an artifact of stellar activity, and thus the planet does not exist.The star is named after E. E. Barnard,[16] an American astronomer who in 1916 measured its proper motion as 10.3 arcseconds per year relative to the Sun, the highest known for any star. The star had previously appeared on Harvard University photographic plates in 1888 and 1890.Barnard's Star is among the most studied red dwarfs because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator.[7] Historically, research on Barnard's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, its astrometry, and also refining the limits of possible extrasolar planets. Although Barnard's Star is ancient, it still experiences stellar flare events, one being observed in 1998.Barnard's Star has been subject to multiple claims of planets that were later disproven. From the early 1960s to the early 1970s, Peter van de Kamp argued that planets orbited Barnard's Star. His specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid-1970s after much debate. In November 2018, a candidate super-Earth planetary companion known as Barnard's Star b was reported to orbit Barnard's Star. It was believed to have a minimum mass of 3.2 MEarth and orbit at 0.4 AU.[19] However, work presented in July 2021 refuted the existence of this planet.",

    description:'OI-1452 b is a confirmed super-Earth exoplanet, possibly a water world, orbiting a red-dwarf star TOI-1452 about 100 light-years away in the Draco constellation.[2][3] The exoplanet is about 70% larger in diameter than Earth, and roughly five times as massive.The exoplanet, known as TOI-1452 b, is slightly greater in size and mass than Earth and is located at distance from its star where its temperature would be neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist on its surface. The astronomers believe it could be an “ocean planet,” a planet completely covered by a thick layer of water, similar to some of Jupiter’s and Saturn’s moons.In an article published in August  in The Astronomical Journal, Cadieux and his team describe the observations that elucidated the nature and characteristics of this unique exoplanet.NASAs space telescope TESS, which surveys the entire sky in search of planetary systems similar to our own,  put the researchers on the trail of TOI-1452 b. Based on the TESS signal, which showed a slight decrease in brightness every 11 days, astronomers predicted a planet about 70% larger in diameter or roughly 5 times the volume than the Earth.Charles Cadieux belongs to a group of astronomers that does ground follow-up observations of candidates identified by TESS in order to confirm their planet type and characteristics. He uses PESTO, a camera installed on Observatoire du Mont-Mégantic (OMM) Telescope developed by Université de Montréal Professor David Lafrenière and his Ph.D. student François-René Lachapelle.The OMM played a crucial role in confirming the nature of this signal and estimating the planet’s radius,” explained Cadieux. “This was no routine check. We had to make sure the signal detected by TESS was really caused by an exoplanet circling TOI-1452, the largest of the two stars in that binary system.The host star TOI-1452 is much smaller than our Sun and is one of two of similar size stars in a binary system. The two stars orbit each other and are separated by such a small distance — 97 astronomical units, or about two and a half times the distance between the Sun and Pluto — that the TESS telescope sees them as a single point of light. But PESTO’s resolution is high enough to distinguish the two objects, and the images showed that the exoplanet does orbit TOI-1452, which was confirmed through  subsequent observations by a Japanese team.To determine the planet’s mass, the researchers then observed the system with SPIRou, an instrument installed on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii. Designed in large part in Canada, SPIRou is ideal for studying low-mass stars such as TOI-1452 because it operates in the infrared spectrum, where these stars are brightest. Even then, it took more than 50 hours of observation to estimate the planet’s mass, which is believed to be nearly five times that of Earth.Researchers Étienne Artigau and Neil Cook, also with iREx at the Université de Montréal, played a key role in analysing the data. They developed a powerful analytic method capable of detecting the planet in the data collected with SPIRou.SPIRou was built to enhance our understanding of exoplanets and star systems far from the Earth by monitoring the tiny shift or wiggle in a star’s spectra over time.  We observed TOI-1452 for four months every possible night SPIRou was on the telescope, capitalizing on the extreme stability and reliability of the instrument.”  said Luc Arnold, SPIRou instrument scientist at CFHT.  “The discovery by Cadieux and the team is the first of many strange new worlds SPIRou will help to uncover.',
